# FirstChoroplethMap

## This web map displays obesity rates across U.S. states, using a choropleth color scheme to visually differentiate rates. Each state is shaded with a color that corresponds to its obesity rate, allowing users to see at a glance which states have higher or lower rates. The map includes hover and click interactionsâ€”when a user hovers over a state, the map highlights the state and shows the exact obesity rate. Clicking a state zooms in, providing a closer view. The map's code uses JavaScript with the Leaflet library to create the base map, load state boundaries from a GeoJSON file, and apply a custom color scale based on obesity rates. This interactivity and styling help convey the data meaningfully, making it easy for users to interpret and explore geographic health trends across the country.
